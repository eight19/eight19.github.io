Iâ€™m Karthik, full-stack web developer from India, live in England. I'm currently a "Senior Consultant" at Torry Harris Business Solutions where we provide software services to enterprise clients.

My primary principles: Web is for everyone & Web site should be easy to use. The combination of both is a long-lived investment that helps to achieve business goals. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive designs.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me watching/playing cricket or spending time with family.
